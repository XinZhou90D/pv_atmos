These examples show the functionality of the pv-atmos package.

example_flat.py will construct a rectangular box with zonal wind data and a full labeled grid.
example_sphere.py will construct a spherical geometry with "shells" to mimic of radial grid points.
example_ocean.py will constract a rectangular ocean basin, including all contients, and show an isosurface of oxygen concentration.

When running the examples, be sure to set the variable pvAtmosPath to the path of the package files atmos_basic.py and atmos_grids.py.
